## Some Design Afterthought's

The datasheet states the minimum operating of the REF03 should be 4.5V but during testing the output voltage remained stable upto 3V with no Load.
If the application has a requirement to sink some current, the supply voltage should be well above the minimum limits. A cut-off voltage circuit should be implemented to make sure the supply voltage remains above the minimum operating voltage.
